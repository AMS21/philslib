 *
 * The 'Concept' type must be a pure abstract base class that serves as the
 * type that defines the interface. All the member functions, excluding
 * the destructor, of the 'Concept' type must be pure virtual.
 * The destructor of the 'Concept' type must be declared virtual.
 * The 'Concept' type must define a pure virtual 'clone' member function
 * that used for cloning (virtual copy constructor). The return type of
 * that 'clone' pure virtual member function must be std::unique_ptr<Concept>.
 * The 'Model' type must be a template type that has one template type
 * parameter, that template type parameter may be any type wrapped by the
 * 'Model' template type. The 'Model' template type must be derived from
 * 'Concept' and implement all the virtual member functions of 'Concept'.
 * The 'clone' virtual member function of 'Model' shall return a copy
 * of itself as std::unique_ptr<Concept>.
 * Can be used to 'put' types into a 'type-hierarchy' that cannot derive
 * from any type. Allows putting types that fulfill the Concept through
 * the Model into the corresponding ConceptPoly without the implementation
 * type needing to be derived from any type, resulting in looser coupling
 * and allowing the type to be used outside of any type-hierarchy, completely
 * avoiding virtual function call overhead. Provides value semantics rather
 * than reference semantics.
