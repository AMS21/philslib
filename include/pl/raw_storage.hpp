 * \brief Low-level building block that holds raw memory storage large enough
 *        to hold exactly one object of type 'Ty'.
 *        Offers an interface to create and destroy the object of type 'Ty'.
 *        Useful for implementing higher level abstractions like optional.
 * \note Ty may not be a reference type as references are not objects.
 * \warning Beware of using const qualified objects or references or objects
 *          containing subobjects which are const qualified or references
 *          in RawStorages. The compiler may assume that 'constant's
 *          like const qualified objects or references may not be modified
 *          including when they, or the the object containing them, are 
 *          destroyed and the memory region they had occupied is reused
 *          to construct a new object into. A possible solution is to access
 *          the newly constructed object only through 
 *          std::launder (since C++17).
