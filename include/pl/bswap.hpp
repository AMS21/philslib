 *        reversed.
 * \return An object of type Type that has its bytes reversed.
 * \note Can be used to get the big endian version of something when passing

 * \note You probably don't want to pass large objects as they're copied into

 *
 * Takes a copy of the argument passed and puts that copy into the parameter.
 * The bytes of that copy are then reversed and the result is passed back out.
