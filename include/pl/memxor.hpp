 * \brief Bytewise xor-assigns the memory pointed to by 'destination'
 *        with the memory pointed to by 'source'.
 * \param destination The buffer that will be xor-assigned to.
 *                    May not be nullptr!
 * \param source The buffer with which 'destination' shall be xored.
 *               May not be nullptr!
 * \param byteCount The size in bytes of the source buffer.
 *                  The destination buffer must be at least as large as
 *                  'byteCount'. You probably want to use buffers of equal
 *                  byte size for 'destination' and 'source'.
 * \return 'destination' is returned.
 * \warning Make sure 'byteCount' is correct!
