 * \brief The slide algorithm slides a range in a container to another place
 *        in the same container.
 * \param first The beginning of the range to slide.
 * \param last The end of the range to slide. (One after the last element
 *        considered part of the range)
 * \param place The position in the container to slide the range to.
 * \return The new first and last iterators of the range that was slid
 *         within the container. (note that last is one after the last element
 *         considered part of the range)
 * \note All iterators passed in must point into the same container.
 * \note The last iterator is not considered part of the range. Ranges are
 *       typically half open in C++.
 * \note After running this function the range denoted by first and last will
 *       now begin at place.
 *
 * Slides the range in a container denoted by first and last to place
 * in the same container. After the operation the range denoted by first
 * and last will now begin at place. Returns the new first and last iterators
 * of the range that was slid within the container.
 * Note that all iterators must point into the same container
 * Also note the the last iterator is not considered part of the range as
 * ranges are typically half open in C++.
